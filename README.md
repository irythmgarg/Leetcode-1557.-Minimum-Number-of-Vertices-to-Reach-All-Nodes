# ðŸš€ Minimum Number of Vertices to Reach All Nodes

This project contains a clean and efficient C++ solution to the problem of finding the smallest set of vertices from which all nodes in a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** can be reached.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Given a directed acyclic graph with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, and a list of directed edges, return the smallest set of vertices from which all nodes are reachable.

> The graph is guaranteed to be a DAG (no cycles).

---

## ðŸ’¡ Intuition

A node with **no incoming edges** cannot be reached from any other node. So, we must **include all such nodes** in our result to ensure reachability for the entire graph.

---

## ðŸ§  Algorithm

1. Create an array to store the **indegree** of each node.
2. Traverse all edges and update the indegree.
3. Collect nodes with **zero indegree** â€” these are the starting nodes.

## ðŸ§¾ Example

### Input:
n = 6
edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,5],[3,4],[4,2]]
### Output:
[0,3]
